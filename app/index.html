We're open to anyone interested in the topic. Whether you're a beginner dying to poke questions at someone with experience or a veteran wanting to discuss the finer details, come along. We can help with specific questions for your problem, write or review some code together.

                           We have great news for this new year. The 25th january 2014 we will be holding a special event at Mobile World Center. The event will consist in a main presentation hold by a reputed speaker and several workshops covering concrete topics such as testing or mobile apps. We will make them in a hands-on format so we encourage everybody to bring his laptop and get dirty coding with us. Thanks a lot to the people of <a href="http://www.barcelonajs.org">BarcelonaJS</a> for making this possible.

                        One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked. "What's happened to me?"</small></p>
